Shay Cormac

Shay is a little useless virus.

It is a self-replicating windows executable file which uses batch files to stop the user to operate the Windows Operating System to perform its task.

Upon execution, it will open the command prompt and appear to be a msg from Microsoft Utility that a virus has been detected and after that it will just open multiple times command prompt and it wont allow the user to operate.

Last tested on Windows 10 64 bits
